# beerApp-vanillaJS
This is one of the many projects I took up to fine tune my skill in frontend developement, It was a screenshot of a project completed by someone in a forum, I found it intresting so I took it up. This is written in vanilla javascript, but I have also converted it to a React js app(it is also in my repo) 

## demo
run the demo here https://theophilly.github.io/beerApp-vanillaJS/

## limitations
This project is just a pratice project on the frontend, hence there is no backend or much fancy stuff
