# BeerApp-vanillaJS
This is one of the many projects I took up to fine tune my skill in frontend developement, It was a screenshot of a project completed by someone in a forum, I found it intresting so I took it up. This is written in vanilla javascript, but I have also converted it to a [React js app](https://github.com/theophilly/beerApp-react)
